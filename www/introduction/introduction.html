        <p>Git is a form of something we call "Source Version Control". It's extremely helpful in managing code
        and working on large projects with many people. It allows you to store files and differences between 
        files. These differences are stored in what we like to call "commits".</p>

    <div class="question">
        <h2>Commits</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        <p>Commits, as I mentioned before, store information about your files and what the difference is between copies of your project.
        Each commit stores a state of your application.
        So, for example, if you changed your <code>index.html</code> from "Hello" to "Hello World", and committed it, your current commit
        would state that one line change.</p>

    <div class="question">
        <h2>Branches</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        <p>Commits are on what we call "Branches". Branches go off of other branches. The main branch is called master. It usually holds
        the "official" copy of the application you're writing. So, each branch has a different "copy" of the application than the other.
        The differences between branches are shown by the commits in each branch.
